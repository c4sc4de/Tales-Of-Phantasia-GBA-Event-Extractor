Usage:

1. Put your Tales of Phantasia GBA ROM in the same directory as this script.
2. Enter the filename of the ROM. This will create MANY files in this folder.

Each file is named after the location of the pointer to the event table and the actual event table location.

Please note, this is my first REAL project in C, so it's likely got some bugs and is not written well.
From my testing it seems to handle everything perfectly, but the whole point of making this was so I
could learn C and not have to comb through everything byte by byte

If you have any ideas for features or find bugs, let me know on discord, currently bjorkfan62 :D
